## Shortcomings:

- Better type support would be in interesting.
- More/BETTER structured type or interfaces would allow avoiding casting objects, like `as Scene`.
- Boilerplate allows for tests with jest. Time constraints didn't.
- Extensive testing on mobile devices for resizing wasn't possible. Small issues were found and switching to Desktop mode seems to fix some. Investigation needed.

## Commands:

-   `npm run build` - starts build procedure
-   `npm run start` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8080
